# aroz.be WebSite

Portfolio that represents my skills in web development and others. Realized for the moment in HTML/CSS/JS with two libraries [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) and [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/). For the moment a simple showcase site. The site is not finished, it will be improved day by day.
